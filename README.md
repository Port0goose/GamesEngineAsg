Games Engine 1 Assigment

This Assignment was created in Godot, a replacement for Unity, as I was having a lot of trouble executing the scenes. With that in mind, the project is centered around creating something from the 70s and 80s using a games engine. For my project, I decided to emulate one of the tanks from the widely known and acclaimed series of movies Star Wars. This tank is also known as All Terrain Scout Transport (aka AT-ST).

The setting in this Assignment is an AT-ST roaming through the deserts of Tatooine, a desert planet. This Assignment offers two perspectives, the first one is 1st person perspective, and the second one is 3rd person perspective, which the user can change between them by pressing the number one key for the 1st person perspective and the number two key for the 3rd person perspective. The user can control the AT-ST by pressing the W key for forward movement and the S key for backward movement. The user can also rotate both perspectives by moving the mouse around.
Unfortunately, the VR implementation doesn't work since I don't have the equipment to be able to test this feature, although the correct nodes have been added to the project.
